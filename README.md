## Job search (JobSpy)

The `backend/` folder exposes a small FastAPI service that wraps
[JobSpy](https://github.com/speedyapply/JobSpy) to scrape job postings from
Indeed, LinkedIn, ZipRecruiter, Glassdoor, and Google.

### Run the backend

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```

### API

`GET /api/jobs`

| Param | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `search_term` | Job title or keywords (required) |
| `location` | City, state, or "remote" |
| `site_name` | Repeatable: `indeed`, `linkedin`, `zip_recruiter`, `glassdoor`, `google` |
| `results_wanted` | Max results per site (default 20) |
| `hours_old` | Only jobs posted within this many hours |
| `is_remote` | Filter to remote jobs |
| `country_indeed` | Country for Indeed/Glassdoor search (default `USA`) |

Example:

```
GET /api/jobs?search_term=software+engineer&location=Remote&site_name=indeed&site_name=linkedin
```

### Frontend

`frontend/index.html` is a minimal static page that calls the API and lists
results. Open it directly in a browser (with the backend running on
`localhost:8000`), or serve it with any static file server.
